## What 

A lot of us on the left were surprised, not just by the result of the 2024 election but by the one-sidedness of the outcome. I was surprised. Unlike 2016, I never thought it was impossible Trump would win, I just was expecting a much closer election. That's what all the pundits and polls had me thinking. So what happened? Since Tuesday, I've been racking my brain to come up with some explanation and I think I'm starting to have one. TLDR: it's very much along the same lines as Bernie's analysis, however I do want to offer a few original thoughts of my own.

People want change over decency. 

Not just any chance, institutional, political and economic change.

Neoliberalism is dead.

I think there's two reasons I didn't vote. The first is my growing afinity for anarchism and increasing skepticism of the possibility of individuals driving any sort of change. 

Leftists need to learn to think long-term. We're constantly playing defense on the shortterm. We need 10, 20, 30, 50 year plans.

people want change more than they want a good person, or a woman, or a person of color as president
- this is why the question was never about turning voters, but getting voters to come out
- this is a big reason I didn't vote
- they should offer someone who is a good person and a change and a woman and a person of color
- the democrats cut a deal in 2016 and are incredibly undemocratic
- Obama has a lot of responsibility for this
- during the campaign they used "democracy" but what they actually meant was the status quo of power structures
- Putin is accelerating this 
- how to respond to asymmetric warfare?
- this is warfare and national security
- Americans are too strict about what constitutes war
- how to react?
- you can't bomb
- in the interest of national security, you respond with a robust social safety net
- Bernie's right
- what about both being women?
- yes, people are sexist
- this argument unlocks military budget for social programs
- definition of change: institutions have to change, not just people. we have to do *hard* things - it was *hard* to overturn Roe v. Wade, it's hard is not an excuse, it was *hard* to go to the moon, it was *hard* for Putin to conduct his psyop on the US, things being hard is not an excuse
