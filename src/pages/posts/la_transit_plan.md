## Description

I want to apply the framework provided in `Half-Earth Socialism` to an economic plan for transportation in LA County. This project is an attempt to combine several interests of mine and provide an excuse to do more in-depth and focused research into public transit, environmental modeling, and socialism. Half-Earth Socialism will serve as the guiding framework, but I want this project to draw upon many sources. An alternative way of describing the project is that, if we imagine the Half-Earth revolution has happened, what should the initial plan for transportation infrastructure in the LA County area look like?

I'd like follow the precedent set out in Half-Earth Socialism in proving some historical and perhaps philosophical context to complement some of the more technical aspects of the project.

Some topics to cover:

- Motivation for the project?
- Goals/aspirations for the project? How do I want it to be used?
- Who is the project for?
- Feasibility of the plan(s) actually being implemented?
- Why Half-Earth Socialism?
- Why transit in Los Angeles?
- History of transit in the area
- How to deal with the problem of not having a more macro economic plan to guide this one?
- What is the timeframe for this plan? How long would it take?
- What metrics would be the focus? What is the objective function(s)?
- How many plans to produce? Why that number?
- How should the plan be decided upon? 
- Describe some plans
- Run plans through game
- Run plans through some models
- Some remarks on what might come up in later plans. Historisities. Part of the utility of a plan are the possible futures in makes available and restricts us from

I think in keeping with the spirit of democratic socialism, the aim of this project should be to produce a few different plans that could then be voted on by the local electorate and discuss the tradeoffs between them.

Possible research sources:

- Half-Earth Socialism
- Road to Nowhere
- Look at sources provided by planning YouTube videos related to LA  

Incentives oil and gas to do Geo thermal

Topics:

The moral justification for mass public transit

The economic justification for mass public transit

Mass public transit is a service, not a business

It is a “force multiplier”

It shouldn't be expected to make any profit

Why certain infrastructure should be a monopoly and publicly owned - nationalizing the trains

The NYC transit paradigm

- Everything goes through Manhattan because of wallstreet
- History
- G train
- What are we considering “LA”?
- LA is a megalopolis
- Everything from the beach to Palm Springs has some justification for being included
- What is the “urban core”?
- Where do suburbs start?

LA History and Geometry
- LA is a horizontal city
- Redcar was mass transit and not public mass transit
- LA is multi-polar

- DTLA - Different than Manhattan
- West: Santa Monica
- Southwest: LAX?
- South: Long beach
- Southeast: ?
- East: East LA
- Northeast: Old town Pasadena

- LA future

- Challenges

- Climate
- Water
- Housing
- Jobs
- Poverty
- Public safety
- Education

- What LA could look like in 100 years

- “From the summit to the sea”

- Metrolink's
- High-speed rail
- Bus
- Lightrail
- Cars?
- Electric cars?
- Bikes
- Walking
- A day in the life of someone from each polis

- In NYC it can take as much as 45 mins to an hour to go from one part to another like Coney Island
- So how do we design so that it takes no more than 1 hour to go from anywhere in LA to anywhere else?

- Capillaries and arteries of transport
- Altadena:

- Light rail down Lake and Altadena Drive

What do people do regularly? Infrastructure people need access to with 15 mins

- Work
- Laundry
- Groceries
- Post office
- Bank
- Childcare
- School
- Elderly care
- Hospital
- Light rail station
- Recreation
- Parks
- Restaurants
- Bars

5 walk mins to bus

10 walk mins to lightrail

15 mins walk/lightrail to speedrail

30 mins to any other speed rail hub

45 - 1 hr anywhere in LA from anywhere

Speedrail

- Grade separated
- Okay to go on medians
- Fast and direct
- Infrequent stops
- BART + HSR
- Can we use metrolink?
- How does Surfliner fit in?
- What are the limits?
- How does CA HSR fitin?

Lightrail

- Semi-grade separated
- Not okay to go on medians
- Frequent stops
- Faster than bus, slower then speed rail
- Current Metro trains with upgrades, more stops

Dare Mighty Things

The problem with a book like this

We are actually pretty good at coming up with ambitious plans

What we really need is sustained effort, funding, and the political will to make driving worse

My defense is that my impact is pretty limited

The problem with transit people is that we are susceptible to making the same mistake again. How to make inclusive transit policy?

NIMBYs aren't all bad. NIMBYs saved SF from being covered in freeways. We need more nuanced conversations around transit and housing policy.

Housing and transit are connected

We need to get past the low hanging fruit. It's easy to be in favor of projects that don't disrupt traffic. Ideal policy would be a massive effort to go around buy up parking lots and convert them to 80-90 % affordable housing.
