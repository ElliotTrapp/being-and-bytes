Look, we all know the world isn't perfect. We all want the world to be better! Poverty, homelessness, global warming, these are some of the greatest challenges of our time. In order to solve these seemingly intractable problems we need to buckle down, roll up our sleeves, and get to work. The last thing we need is more pie in the sky, never going to work, na√Øve idealism. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 

In our world today, seems like a sensible point of view. Where has being overly principled ever gotten us, really? Well I'd like to unpack this notion of The Good, The Perfect, and if they really are in fact potential adversaries. Not in an effort to refute or disprove anything, per she, but really to push the idea forward and show how it can serves us better and where it leads us astray. 

One arena where this type of thinking regularly comes to the fore is in urban planning and local politics. At times, it seems everyone is disappointed in their local leaders and governance, and others say this is a sign that things are working swimmingly. That is to say, politics is the art of the possible, not the perfect. If some got the city of their dreams, others would be living a despotic nightmare. The Tragedy of the Commons is alive and well in buerocratic world of public policy. Perhaps there's an example somewhere in this domain that could serves as a fruitful case study as we explore the the complex interplay between The Perfect and The Good. 

It's hard to find a more neglected area of American politics than public transportation planning. Largely forgotten due to the car supposedly being the end all solution to moving masses of people around tight urban spaces. 

The major commercial street in Pasadena is Colorado Ave. It became the hotbed of economic activity it is today because the pacific electric rail car used to run down it. At the time, it made sense that businesses wanted to be as close to the train line as possible to capture people going about their lives. 

You can imagine an overly simplified conversation going something like:
- I want public transit
- I do to, but we can't intterupot business. Maybe do it on the 210
- I don't know, seems a lot worse
- I know but don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good 
- okay, let's do it

What happened here? The problem comes down to the end goal. Literally building a pub transit system vs getting people out of cars and onto active modes of transit, reducing care ownership. 

Another problem is a misunderstanding of the point of public transit. Public transit isn't just about literally moving people, by increasing economic prosperity by increasing equitable access to jobs and commerce and increasing property values. No one wants to live near a freeway. Areas directly next to freeways inevitability become economically depressed. The exact opposite is true with robust public transit. Even more, that new train line doesn't directly hurt any areas either. It's pure win. 

Now the argument becomes, well there's already a train but no one takes it. Building a train down the middle of a freeway is worse than no train at all.
