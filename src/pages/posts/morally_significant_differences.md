I just watched a video on YouTube where a speaker, presumably at a college campus, is Socratically engaging with a pair of students on the question of what gives something moral standing. She asks about the standing of a series of different entities, including a puppy, blade of grass, fish, single-celled organism on Mars. She uses this a rhetorical technique to show that we all accept that, at least the students she's questioning, accept that there gradations of moral worth. Some living things matter more than others. "There are moral hierarchies between different types of biological beings". The speaker then states she sees it as unacceptable that some forms of life like a blade of grass or a single-celled organism on Mars is "worthy of our undying love, support, and protection but a human being isn't".

So, the speaker is espousing humanism. She assents to the notion that there is something about being human that makes something inherently valuable. But this just begs the question, what is it about being human that makes something valuable? Philosophers have interrogated this claim for thousands of years. It's not our intelligence, but our capacity to suffer that gives us inherent value. And the capacity of suffer (not to mention make decisions, be aware of it's environment, think) of a pig is lightyears ahead of a zygote. This is why, even on face value, a fully mature pig, on basic utilitarian principles has a higher moral standing that a collection of cells in a human womb. There may be some point in development where this relationship flips, but that is besides the point. The point is, there is a time when there is a fertilized human egg within a womb which is clearly radically less capable of suffering (it literally perceives less, has fewer neurons, has a less developed nervous system) than most developed mammals.

But this isn't even the heart of the problem. The real issue is the that all ethical deliberations are necessarily framed within our linguistic and logical framework. What does this mean? It means that there is one and only one type of moral argument. The only rational toolset we have to argue that such and such thing matters is to take as a precondition that something else matters (human beings, reason, autonomy, western civilization, white men, etc.) and then argue that we ought to extend moral concern to some other thing based on it's similarity to the first thing that we all already agree matters.

This is actually a *really* huge problem. The French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty understood how significant of a problem this is. Think about it. If analogy with something that already matters is the only basis upon which we can establish moral concern, we are woefully unequipped to develop robust moral hierarchies that accurately reflect the messiness of the real world. The only way this logical structure could even be remotely productive is if we take as a given that our moral universe is the only more universe that exists. Meaning, we started from a single point and slowly built out a map of what matters based on what was like us in ways we felt were meaningful. But this approach faces the same pitfalls as certain optimization problems can in mathematics. In something like stochastic gradient decent, where you are trying to find the minimum value of some function, you always run the risk of running into a local minimum, that isn't a true global minimum. It's very easy to make this mistake.

Something about not being able to prove a negative. Showing that something is not like us doesn't prove it doesn't have value, it just fails to show that it does.
