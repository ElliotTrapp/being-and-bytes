Many people in the United States ascribe, intentionally or unintentionally to some form of "American Exceptionalism". Perhaps the most dominate formulation of this belief is something like, "The United States is the greatest country on Earth." Without too much thought, it is easy to see how this imprecise proposition can be interpreted in a great many way. Nonetheless, this belief has become somewhat of a cornerstone of American civic culture and national politics. 

Russia's intervention in the 2016 American presidential election was a watershed moment in so many ways. One way, I'd argue, this event should be understood is as a sort of "rebuttal" to the idea that the United States is exceptional among states. You could almost describe this hack as a sort of empirical experiment to see if the United States could be "brought down" to the level of other nations and exposed for the fraud that it is. In other words, it was an attempt to prove to the United States and the world, that in the US, which conceptualizes itself as a bastion of liberal democracy, power still reigned supreme. While we might talk a big talk, in the end, American politics was all about becoming the dominate group and maintaining that status for as long as possible.

So, in this light, an oversimplification might be to see the 2016 hack as a debate over the question, whether or not the United States *is* exceptional. For now, let's bracket what we mean by exceptional and interrogate the question, *is* the United States exceptional in anyway, culturally, politically, historically, etc. 

For my money, as long as the debate is understood as being over this empirical, descriptive question as to the metaphysical status of the US, if you will, then I would say the 2016 hack was a resounding success, in that it made a great many Americans doubt their country was special in any significant way.

But I posit that that was almost a forgone conclusion to the proposition as originally proposed. In fact, the conclusion one should draw from the 2016 hack is not that the United States is or is not exceptional in anyway, but that the question was a misguided one to begin with. 

American Exceptionalism should not be understood as a question of fact for the current status of the United States. Instead, American Exceptionalism is a question of normatively. True American Exceptionalism is the idea that Americans should look around at the status quo of how other people and states behave and hold themselves to a higher standard. Not in an effort to show that they are better than anyone else, but merely because that is what it *should* mean to be an American. Not that America is better than any other place in the world, but we should hold our self to the highest standard. That is American Exceptionalism.

In my mind, one of the greatest illustrative examples of true American Exceptionalism, comes from a historical myth that I was told growing up. Now I can't comment on the voracity of whether or not this myth was merely a myth or rose to the level of fact, but that, in some sense, is besides the point. All that matters really is that, at least in some circles, this is an American myth that some Americans believe in.

The myth is the notion, that during the Second World War, when other countries took in POWs it was understood that the norms of the time was to commit various acts of torture. I'm certainly not saying that all nations at all times always committed torture against POWs. Only that, at that time, when torture did take place it was not considered out of character or against any norms or rules, in a time of war. But growing up, I was always taught, while not universally or really inherently true, there were times in which, when Americans took in German or Japanese POWs they refrained from engaging in torture, *because they were American.* It was understood that torture, while might be okay for other countries to engage in, was something Americans just did not do. 

I could see someone understandably interpreting what I'm saying as claiming some historical fact or superiority, that Americans did not engage in torture or that other countries did, without any hesitation. That's not what I'm trying to say. I'm trying to convey what this myth told me growing up about what being American meant. It didn't mean we *were* better, it meant we *ought* to be better. You can always fail a *ought* but it is something you aspire to. That's what American Exceptionalism is. It's something we ought to aspire to.
