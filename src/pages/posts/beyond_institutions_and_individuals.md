# Intro
In H. Peter Steeves' latest book *Up From Under the Rulers: The Anarchic Phenomenological Communitarian Manifesto* he proposes a framework for thinking beyond the typically intractable ethical, ontological, and political debates that occupy the minds and texts of so many great thinkers. One of its most significant accomplishments is, following the groundbreaking phenological work of Edmund Husserl, providing the tools to escape the traditional mind/body or material/idealist divisions that have enraptured students of philosophy for centuries. Here, I seek to comment on and highlight how Steeves' work additionally empowers us to sidestep the contemporary American political debate between the centrality of individual responsibility in comparison to collective, or institutional, action. Only by incorporating the tenets of anarchism, is Steeves' able to, not argue for one side of this debate or another, but nullify the premises that underpin it.

# Stakes
While individual vs. collective action has been a mainstay of political debate in the English speaking world for at least hundreds of years, here I'm particularly interested in how this debate has been deployed around conversations of response to the current myriad environmental crises including the fifth mass extinction, zoonotic diseases, and of course, climate change. Whether it's plastic recycling, electric vehicles, alternative sources of energy, etc. The environmental debates of our day almost inevitably lead back to the question of how much can and show I do, as an individual, vs. how much responsibility does the corporations, state, and other institutions bear in resolving this crises? It's a question with real stakes. Many of us alive today can realistically expect to see mass exodus away from the equatorial regions and global state and/or private geoengineering experiments with unimaginable practical, moral, political, and economic ramifications for generations to come.

# Collective vs. Institutional
- In the modern world, what is collective action that is outside or non-institutional? It doesn't really exist
- Probably the closest thing would be a group of friends deciding collectively where to eat dinner, but they are still caught up in the economy, restaurants, metropolitan life, etc. 
- This is all just to say, I'll use institutional interchangeably with collective, because I don't think we can even think of what it means to act collectively outside of an institution

# Scapegoats for the Left and the Right
- Both the left and the right are essentially doing the same thing, using their position on this debate as justification for inaction
- Without individual action, there is no collective action. Leftists want something to change, but as soon as you bring up the idea of actually doing something, they say, well what can I do, I'm just an individual
- But they are right. Many of our global problems are essentially held hostage by global institutions. As long as those institutions are divorced from our anarchic will, there will always be someone "else" to blame. 
- It's not about proving if it's an individual or institutional problem. It's about disolving the distinction between the individual and the institution: anarchy
- But if you tell a leftist environmentalist that their individual action of eating meat is the worst thing they can do for the planet, they immediately say they have no power
- The right does the same thing, rejecting all efforts to regulate institutions, because they claim that we as individuals have the real power. In many ways, they are very close to being right, but employ this thinking not as a way to empower people and create change for the good, but to escape all forms of accountability
- Both the left and the right are both right and wrong

# Institutions and Anarchy
- Institutions do the work of being persons for us
- In some ways, the anarchist sees the problem not as institutions, but the divide between our anarchic everyday life and the institutions that govern the wider world
- Institutions provide an "other" to blame
