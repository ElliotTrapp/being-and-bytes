- How to Think About Animals
- Animal Perspectives
- What Can We Say About Animals?
- Animal Voices
- Giving Voice to the Voiceless
- Voice for the Voiceless
- A response to Martha Nussbaum’s Justice for Animals
- Self-directed capacity for movement as a basis for modern standing

- Behaviorism over psycholigism (psychology?)
- Human jurisdiction doesn’t reach into the animal kingdom. We don’t police predation.
- Slavery understood as “other-directed capacity for movement”. Slavery is wrong because the entity loses it’s capacity for movement
- That German concept about the logic of history and how it makes sense that a being would develop a capacity for self-directed movement alongside a capacity for signals telling it what is good or what is bad, one instance of this is pleasure/pain
- So much of evil is based around restricting movement. Chickens confined to houses, gestation crates, calf's stuck in boxes to become veal
- This framework might not apply to other “forms of life” - like dignity (think of others). But maybe it does? Maybe dignity is the lack of self-direction.
- Okay, distinguish self-direction from autonomy. Autonomy is a boarder concept that is hard to quantify and measure. Capacity for self-movement in the strict physical/biological sense
- Capacity for self-movement is something like a system takes in energy from its environment, stores it, uses that energy to organize itself outside of basic natural laws of gravity, diffusion, osmosis, etc.
- Two important distinctions with other approaches

- I’m not saying this establishes that entities that don’t have this capacity, don’t matter. That is not what I’m establishing here. Only establishing the positive.
- another?

- We have a limited perspective. We could never know what it is like to experience the world as a dog. We need to come to terms with this limitation.
- Reject what Nussbaum says about sharks
- Nussbaum makes a great point about the problems with anatomical analogy, but then she goes and makes the same mistake herself!
- Utilitarian heroes. I’m interpreting the world here, the point however, is to change it.
- I take it as a given that we need to abolish the property status of animals, but this work is meant to answer the question - what is wrong about animals as property/slaves?
- Distinguish this work from politics and half-earth socialism
- What about plants? Plants do have this capacity - they shouldn’t be property
- Saying something shouldn’t be property is not saying you can’t have a relationship with it.

## Intro

- Despite thousands of years of human writings about animals we need to distinguish writing about animals as an interest of humans and writing about animals as having their own interests
- Animal status as property prevents them from having any point of view
- Test: is the first practical conclusion of a moral theory the abolition of the property status of animals? If it is not, then it is a theory of how humans want to treat animals, not about animals having a perspective independent of humanity

## How Humans Have Thought About Animals

### Consequentialism

### Deontology

### The Capacities Approach

- What is the capacities approach to animal ethics?

1. theoretical foundations
2. practical implications
3. legal implications

- What are some other welfare approaches to animal ethics?
- Animals are property. What does this mean?

4. Animals are not agents/persons/beings in any sense under the law. They are indistinguishable from a car, couch, or cell phone
5. The essential characteristic of property is that it has no interests and is incapable of having interests
6. As long as animals are property, any discussion of treatment will always be based on human preferences and interests

- There is a direct historical parallel between this problem and the ethical debates over human slavery

7. If we conclude that animals can remain property and that they can have real moral claims, then why couldn’t the same be said about humans?

1. Wouldn’t this imply humane slavery is possible?

- Science’s role in JFA
- Wonder

8. I really like what she says about wonder
9. As a kid I felt overwhelmed by wonder of the natural world, even today
10. What radicalized me was this wonder + being confronted with the evils of the world, which show that the overwhelming majority of the world don’t share this wonder. The systems of the world operate with total disregard and lack of acknowledgment of this wonder

## Critiques

### Property

11. First critique of the above approaches: one way you can evaluate an ethical theory’s merit, is by evaluating its implications and whether it produces the desired outcomes
12. “Philosopher’s have interpreted the world. The point however, is to change it.”
13. If Nussbaum or anyone’s theory doesn’t lead first to the conclusion that animals ought not to be property under the law, then the theory has no real impact
14. Abolition is the moral baseline for real animal ethics
15. Pathetic excuse for “justice”
16. Gray Francione’s criticisms
17. Thaddeus Stevens and the radical republicans understood that there was a fundamental practical question at stake. Human slavery robbed slaves of a legal, philosophical, and moral point of view

2. The same is true today of animals

## Death

18. The interruption argument regarding the killing of animals
19. Doesn’t this imply we can kill humans in the same way?

## Fish

20. She’s a pescetarian
21. She thinks fish can feel pain but only “live in the moment”

3. Therefore killing them isn’t interrupting anything

23. She argues she needs the fish protein
24. Unnecessary suffering is always wrong
25. If we can prove it’s unnecessary for her to each fish, it is wrong

## Science

25. Potential problems with science’s role in theory

4. Theory could get science wrong
5. Science could get nature wrong

27. The role of science is to describe animal and human nature
28. This approach is based on the premise that we should only give moral consideration to what we are certain matters
29. What about the gray areas?
30. We could have an approach that gives standing both to what we know matters and the gray area

6. Ultimately everything is the gray area

32. It is the philosopher’s job to say what matters, not the scientist
33. It would be immoral and abhorrent to promote a theory that motivated scientific research to determine what classes of humans matter

7. Human protections would be so precarious
8. This is where any non-abolitionist theory leaves animals
9. We need a theory that leaves no space for science to say what fundamentally matters or not
10. This is why disability advocates are so critical of Singer. His theory puts the disabled at the whims of science.

## Solution

- Distinction between ethical theories based on human preferences about animals and animal interests in and of themselves (maybe humanist vs. non-humanist theories?)

- Come up with a name for these classes of theories

- How they map on to animal welfare vs animal rights, how they are the same and different
- We need a non-humanist theory that, firstly leads to the conclusion that we need to abolish the property status of animals
- Francione’s approach + a few tweaks?

- Dependency is not, in and of itself a bad thing

## Private Section

- She’s writing this book for her daughter, not for animals
- This is an animal lover’s book



Vegan food is not just a “personal preference” or a “lifestyle choice” akin to Coke vs. Pepsi.
