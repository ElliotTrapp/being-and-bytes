### Before Me
You know what? I don't know nearly as much as I would like about my ancestors. I want to make a concerted effort to grow my understanding of where I come from. I have some general understanding and I'm familiar with some family stories, but I want to really know the sequence of events that lead to me. Yes that's a bit narcissistic but I don't care. Sue me.

How do I go about learning where I come from? I think first I should write out what I don't know and want to learn, then I can bring that to people to try and fill in the gaps.


### Early Me
I was born in 1989 in Oakland, CA. From what my Mother has told me, I was a popular and content child. Despite the brown hair I have today, I start with golden blonde curly locks.

### Later Me
A lot of people change as they grow, but I think I had a pretty unique experience of really radically transforming who I was in a very short amount of time.
